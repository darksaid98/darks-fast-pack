## ‚ù§Ô∏è Acknowledgments

Optim was created because I grew tired of manually updating my personal selection of mods after every Minecraft update.

The following projects inspired, influenced and or helped me greatly when creating Optim:
- [**mc-modpack-kit**](https://github.com/jh-devv/mc-modpack-kit) - *Used to scaffold this GitHub repository.*
- [**Packwiz**](https://packwiz.infra.link/) - *Exceptional software making modpack maintenance and creation easy.*
- [**Kami Chan Optimized**](https://modrinth.com/modpack/kami-chan-optimized) - *Inspired a few additions like fast-up-ping and Server Pinger Fixer.*
